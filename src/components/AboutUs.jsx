          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <h3>The idea</h3>
          <p>
            In healthcare, the information around our medicines and lab tests is either unavailable or incomprehensible to us.
            So we decided to create a platform that stood for transparent, authentic and accessible information for all.
            This idea grew into a company and Tata 1mg was created in 2015.
          </p>
          <h3>What we offer</h3>
          <p>
            We provide accurate, authoritative & trustworthy information on medicines and help people use their medicines effectively and safely.
            We get medicines and other health products delivered at home in 1000+ cities across India from licensed and verified pharmacies.
            We also provide diagnostic services from certified labs and online doctor consults at any time, from anywhere.
          </p>
          <h3>The journey so far</h3>
          <p>
            Weâ€™ve made health care accessible to millions by giving them quality care at affordable prices.
            We continue to expand our rich and extensive medical content and are working hard to make this information available in multiple local languages.
